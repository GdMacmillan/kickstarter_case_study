# Kickstarter case study

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform for entrepreneurs looking for channels of funding their projects. It involves creating a campaign with the goal of reaching a certain amount of funding in a given time period. This case study was to analyze web scraped data (not included in repo) and build two predictive models in 4-10 hours.

The models will perform the following:
* Predict success or failure of a given Kickstarter campaign
* Predict staff pick of a given Kickstarter campaign
